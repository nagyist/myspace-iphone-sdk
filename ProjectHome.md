## Description ##

The MySpace iPhone SDK provides core functionality to integrate MySpace resources into your iPhone Application

The following actions are exposed directly through the SDK

  * Integrated Login and Logout experience
  * Get and Update Status Mood
  * Get Friends
  * Upload Photo
  * Upload Video

The SDK also comes with a sample Myspace iPhone Application demonstrating use of the above actions.

Over the next few weeks we will add more actions to the SDK, or you can execute any API that is exposed through MyspaceID directly.

Please see our Wiki section for the SDK Details.
